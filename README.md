# Web Browser Playgdound

This is yet another attempt to build a web browser, but this time in Rust. I'll keep trying to implement as much of the JS API as I can and at the same time play with rendering HTML to a window.

I'm using [boa](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa) as the JS engine and [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) for the app.
